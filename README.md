# Capstone-Project-1---Instacart
This project is originally a Kaggle competition at https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis Here it is developed as a capstone project for Springboard data science career track. 
This project enables me to practice data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, model development and result analysis. I analyze order data from 3 million orders of Instacart and develops a model to predict what products customers would like to buy again.
